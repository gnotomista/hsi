        % Initialize velocity to zero for each agent.  This allows us to sum
        % over agent i's neighbors

        % topology

            % For each neighbor, calculate appropriate formation control term and
            % add it to the total velocity

            dx(:, i) = dx(:, i) + ...
            formationControlGain*(norm(x(1:2, i) - x(1:2, j))^2 - weights(i, j)^2) ... 
            *(x(1:2, j) - x(1:2, i));
        end

    % Transform the single-integrator dynamics to unicycle dynamics using a provided utility function
    dx = si_barrier_cert(dx, x);

    % Set velocities of agents 1:N
