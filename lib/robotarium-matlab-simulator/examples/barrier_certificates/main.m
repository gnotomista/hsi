%% Set up Robotarium object 
% Before starting the algorithm, we need to initialize the Robotarium
% object so that we can communicate with the agents

% Get Robotarium object used to communicate with the robots/simulator
rb = RobotariumBuilder();

% Get the number of available agents from the Robotarium.  We don't need a
% specific value for this algorithm
N = rb.get_available_agents(); 

% Set the number of agents and whether we would like to save data.  Then,
% build the Robotarium simulator object!
r = rb.set_number_of_agents(N).set_show_figure(false).set_save_data(false).build();

% This is a totally arbitrary number
iterations = 20000;

%% Experiment constants 
% Next, we set up some experiment constants

% Initialize velocity vector for agents.  Each agent expects a 2 x 1
% velocity vector containing the linear and angular velocity, respectively.
dx = zeros(2, N);

% This code ensures that the agents are initially distributed around an
% ellipse.  
xybound = [-.4, .4, -0.7, 0.7];
p_theta = (1:2:2*N)/(2*N)*2*pi;
p_circ = [xybound(2)*cos(p_theta) xybound(2)*cos(p_theta+pi); xybound(4)*sin(p_theta)  xybound(4)*sin(p_theta+pi)];

x_goal = p_circ(:,1:N);

flag = 0; %flag of task completion

%% Retrieve tools for single-integrator -> unicycle mapping

% Let's retrieve some of the tools we'll need.  We would like a
% single-integrator position controller, a single-integrator barrier
% function, and a mapping from single-integrator to unicycle dynamics
position_int = create_si_position_controller('XVelocityGain', 2, 'YVelocityGain', 2);
si_barrier_certificate = create_si_barrier_certificate('SafetyRadius', 0.1);
si_to_uni_dyn = create_si_to_uni_mapping2('LinearVelocityGain', 0.75, 'AngularVelocityLimit', pi);

%% Begin the experiment
% This section contains the actual implementation of the barrier
% certificate experiment.

%Iterate for the previously specified number of iterations
for t = 1:iterations
    
    % Retrieve the most recent poses from the Robotarium.  The time delay is
    % approximately 0.033 seconds
    x = r.get_poses();
    
    x_temp = x(1:2,:);
    
    %% Algorithm
  
    % Let's make sure we're close enough the the goals
    if norm(x_goal-x_temp,1)<0.08
         flag = 1-flag;
    end
    
    % This code makes the robots switch positions on the ellipse
    if flag == 0
        x_goal = p_circ(:,1:N);
    else
        x_goal = p_circ(:,N+1:2*N);
    end
    
%     x_goal = zeros(2, N);
        
    % Use a single-integrator position controller to drive the agents to
    % the circular formation
    dx = position_int(x(1:2, :), x_goal);
    
    %%
    % Normalization of controls.  This code ensures that
    %%
    % $$
    %   \|dxu\| \leq dmax
    % $$
    dxmax = 0.1;
    for i = 1:N
        if norm(dx(:,i)) > dxmax
            dx(:,i) = dx(:,i)/norm(dx(:,i))*dxmax;
        end
    end

    %% Apply barrier certs. and map to unicycle dynamics
    
    %Ensure the robots don't collide
    dx = si_barrier_certificate(dx, x);
    
    % Transform the single-integrator dynamics to unicycle dynamics using a
    % diffeomorphism, which can be found in the utilities
    dx = si_to_uni_dyn(dx, x);    

    %% Set the velocities of the agents    

    % Set velocities of agents 1,...,N
    r.set_velocities(1:N, dx);
    
    % Send the previously set velocities to the agents.  This function must be called!
    r.step();    
    
end

% Though we didn't save any data, we still should call r.call_at_scripts_end() after our
% experiment is over!
r.call_at_scripts_end();
